# Crafting Interpreters (Rust Edition)

This project follows the awesome [Crafting Interpreters Book](https://craftinginterpreters.com/),
which implements a tree-walk interprer in Java for the imaginary Lox programming
language. In the spirit of "why not", I'm implementing this in Rust.

**Warning**: In the spirit of making bad decisions,
I'm using this project to learn Rust for the first time. Really bad
Rust code lies ahead! You've been warned!
